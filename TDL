# Project: rid

TODO

    Add cmake abstractions
    Same concept as mn* and cm* abstractions.

    Add config options in /etc/rid/config
    Default behavior configuration.

    Add support for sets
    Similar to what gentoo does

    Add retries for downloads
    Not for 404s though. Prompted by pixman's url failing on the first try.

    Reduce redundancy in build failure messages
    "Not tracking package 'libelf' as it failed to build; Failed to track package 'libelf': Not tracking due to build failure"

WIP

    Work on meta files
    Create and test LFS, TLFS, GLFS, and BLFS meta files.

    Test UX
    Fix UX flaws based on feedback.

    Make query_status() much faster
    Done by making it read the json instead of calling form_package()
