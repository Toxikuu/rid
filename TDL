# Project: rid

TODO

    Migrate from using $TARGET_USER to $TU

    Move $RIDSETS to rid-meta

    Add -w flag for writing a metafile
        Uses tmpl which I'll move into ridbin

    Merge stabs and linkval into rid

    Add a PM (PackageManager) struct

    Add a config file
        Ideas:
        - Toggle tarball removal on package removal
        - Custom repositories
            - Could be done by switching the RIDMETA variable in the env file, but ideally, multiple repositories could be supported at once. maybe symlinks are the answer?

    Support -k <PACKAGE>

    Maybe add -m and -M for maintenance (along with $MDIR)

    Rewrite mo in bash

    Add -a flag for ask

WIP

    Improve bootstrapping process
        Improve syncing (rid -i rid currently works great, but maybe make rid -s an alias?)

    Improve documentation

    Work on meta files

    UX Improvements
        Install.sh and the new wrapper script are huge UX improvements

DONEISH

    Remove the option to adjust a few RID variables ($RIDBIN, $RIDSETS, etc.)

    Use git for syncing instead of the current system
        Covered by install.sh

    Deprecate rid-offline
        No longer really necessary to have two binaries because rid uses rustls anyways

    Edit corrupt tarball to check for existence first

    Wrapper bash script
        The alias and the script that calls the symlink work great :fire:

    Make -g only get the tarball if the latest version doesn't exist;
        Make -G always get the tarball

    dependency resolution tweaks (for i, u, r)
        adjust flags such that lowercase flags use default behavior and capital ones do the opposite

    Add a news system

    add installed_version field to json and Package so that the user can run rid -u @lfs, for instance

    Caching progress bar
        Needs more testing

    Add a variable for extra downloads instead of using raw

    Make downloads have progress bars

    add a check for corrupt tarballs (tar: this does not look like an archive) and make it attempt to redownload the tarball

    break up xorg-* into sets

    Revert to '-' instead of '_'

    avoid calling form_package() when unnecessary
        for instance, rid -l @glfs calls form_package() a bunch of times

    make rid auto-detect when it needs to cache and do so automatically and efficiently 

    add @all set

DROPPED

    Add package build flags (formatted as <package>#<feature>)
        Massive pain in the ass

    add * support
        bash expands it before rid can access it unless quoted

    Migrate RIDPKGSVERS to rid-meta
        RIDPKGSVERS has been deprecated

    Make raw check whether a file exists by default and work with -D
        this is rendered obsolete by down()
