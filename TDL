# Project: rid

TODO

    Add a way to specify global version variables
    Maybe do it in env; useful for Python, Perl, or any other packages which rely on the version of another


    Add cmake abstractions
    Same concept as mn* and cm* abstractions.

    Add config options in /etc/rid/config
    Default behavior configuration.

    Add retries for downloads
    Not for 404s though. Prompted by pixman's url failing on the first try.

    Allow fully custom directories
    Would be done through variables defined in /etc/rid/env

    Add an flag to check whether a link is valid
    Make it return the status code as well. Maybe -L?

WIP

    Work on meta files
    Create and test LFS, TLFS, GLFS, and BLFS meta files.

    Test UX
    Fix UX flaws based on feedback.
