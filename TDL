# Project: rid

TODO

    Rewrite mo in bash

    Add package build flags (formatted as <package>#<feature>)

    Allow -D <PKG>

    Add a news system

    Add -a flag for ask

    dependency resolution tweaks (for i, u, r)
        adjust flags such that lowercase flags use default behavior and capital ones do the opposite

WIP

    Improve system for $RID* env vars (maybe a wrapper bash script?)

    Improve documentation

    Work on meta files

    UX Improvements

DONEISH

    add installed_version field to json and Package so that the user can run rid -u @lfs, for instance

    Caching progress bar
        Needs more testing

    Add a variable for extra downloads instead of using raw

    Make downloads have progress bars

    add a check for corrupt tarballs (tar: this does not look like an archive) and make it attempt to redownload the tarball

    break up xorg-* into sets

    Revert to '-' instead of '_'

    avoid calling form_package() when unnecessary
        for instance, rid -l @glfs calls form_package() a bunch of times

    make rid auto-detect when it needs to cache and do so automatically and efficiently 

    add @all set

DROPPED

    add * support
        bash expands it before rid can access it unless quoted

    Migrate RIDPKGSVERS to rid-meta
        RIDPKGSVERS has been deprecated

    Make raw check whether a file exists by default and work with -D
        this is rendered obsolete by down()
