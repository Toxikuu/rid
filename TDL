# Project: rid

TODO

    Add a way to specify global version variables
    Maybe do it in env; useful for Python, Perl, or any other packages which rely on the version of another

    Allow fully custom directories
    Would be done through variables defined in /etc/rid/env

    Add an flag to check whether a link is valid
    Make it return the status code as well. Maybe -L?

WIP

    Work on meta files
    Create and test LFS, TLFS, GLFS, and BLFS meta files.

    Test UX
    Fix UX flaws based on feedback.
